# React e-commerce SPA
React e-commerce website, no UI libraries were used.
## Demo
[Live Demo](https://react-ecommerce.strix.moe/)
## Tools used:
- aos: for scroll based animation
- react-scroll: to animate vertical scrolling

## What i aquired:
deeper understanding of reactjs including:
- state management using context API
- CSS proficiency, as i had to build everything on my own, i know how to use UI component libraries but i saw this as an opportunity to enhance my styling skills.
- hooks: i feel more comfortable using react hooks now.

## Features implemented:
- Responsiveness: The application is responsive for literally all screen sizes, including smartwatches, all components, no exceptions.
- Website header and footer: cool header built from scratch with scroll based animation.
- Newsletter subscription (with backend :P): user can subscribe by submitting his email to the server which will be stored in database
- Search: user can search for products by name and filter by category.
- Product details: user can click on a product to see a detailed view.
- Homepage: cool animations, products list, and showcasing the service.
- Shopping cart: user can add products to shopping cart, view, delete and manage selections.
